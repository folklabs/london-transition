<h2>London Transition: A Year In Review</h2>
<p>For many 2010 started with a sense that the best remedy for
global, instituional paralysis is local, grass roots action, and a
the year has seen much new interest in Transition-style approaches in
the capital both, in official Transition Towns initiatives and in
like minded Low Carbon Communities and Climate Action Networks. Many
new groups were formed, there was continued growth in the size and
ambition of activities and and many firsts. </p>
<p>Collected below is a brief summary of some of the more notable
events from the past year which were initiated or supported by
Transition groups. This list is by no means comprehensive, but
hopefully gives a sense of the movement in London. </p>
<h3>Building Efficiency</h3>
<p>In the UK housing alone contributes 33% of all CO2 emissions. London
groups have been highly active in raising awareness
of building efficiency ranging from <a
 href="http://www.projectdirt.com/events/tt-wimbledon-energy-group">organising</a>
and
<a
 href="http://refurbn16.com/2010/05/23/north-london-eco-house-weekend/">supporting</a>
open day events
of efficient buildings to <a
 href="http://refurbn16.com/2010/10/25/6th-november-gathering-of-people-involved-in-community-energy-efficiency-projects/">community
lead
building efficiency
programmes</a>.</p>
<p>Last winter London Transition groups started running draught busting
workshops teaching people low cost, DIY approaches to reducing energy
bills improving home comfort. These hands-on workshop were pioneered by
<a href="http://www.hydefarm.org.uk/" target="_blank">Hyde Farm CAN</a>
and have spread across the capital.
Transition Belsize is now collaborating with Camden Council who
are&nbsp; funding a series of draught busting workshops and providing <a
 href="http://www.meetup.com/TransitionBelsize/calendar/14004974/?from=list&amp;offset=0">&pound;20
of
free
materials to local residents</a> attending the workshops.
</p>
<h3>Local Energy</h3>
<p>Ham United Group, based in Ham, Richmond are developing a <a
 href="http://e-voice.org.uk/hamunitedgroup/ham-hydro/">hydro
power project</a> on the weir at Teddington, SW London. They aim to be
up
and running by autumn 2012 and providing enough electricity to power
900 homes and save around 1000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a
year.</p>
<p>Transition Belsize Energy Group ran a <a
 href="http://www.meetup.com/TransitionBelsize/calendar/15164095/?from=list&amp;offset=0">solar
power
expo</a> and Ealing Transition organised a <a
 href="http://www.ealingtransition.org.uk/resources/Events/2010-10-19%20Renewable%20Energy%20Mini%20Conference/presentations/Ealing%20Transition%20Introduction.pdf">renewable
energy
conference</a> with representatives from local government,
church groups and solar energy suppliers.</p>
<p>Transition Town
Maidenhead have formed <a href="http://www.smartenergy.coop/">Solar
Co-operative</a> to help households find the right solar thermal, solar
PV or biomass solution and provide support for bulk purchasing,
tendering, selecting installers and organising finance. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.projectdirt.com/group/jfyr">Juice From Your Roof</a>,
a project of <a href="http://www.sustainablemerton.org/">Sustainable
Merton</a>, has sparked wide community support across south-west
London, enrolling over 100 homeowners free-of-charge in the capital's
biggest volunteer-led discount club for solar panels. The club's
&pound;1 million of potential business attracted bids in November from
four reputable solar installation companies who offered discounts of up
to 20%. The club's assessors were taking references and judging quality
of service, before appointing a preferred installer. Other groups like
Transition Town
Peckham are also
looking into setting up local bulk buying schemes.</p>
<h3>Festivals</h3>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Tooting and Kingston both had "great
unleashing" celebrations this year. Kingston's is described <a
 href="http://www.darkoptimism.org/2010/04/20/ttks-great-unleashing-big-launch-party/">here</a>
and attracted hundred of visitors, was attended by local alumni,
MPs, the mayor and head of the Council and supported by local green
businesses and organisations. Tooting's event featured a <a
