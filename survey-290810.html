</table>
<h3>Are there any projects you have run which have been particularly useful to connecting with other groups and organisations in your area?</h3>
<table>
<tr><td>Finsbury Park</td><td>Cycling project targeted at particular communities, growing projects in public spaces </td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Westcombe</td><td>Meetings on traffic, supermarkets</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Crouch End</td><td>Apple Day with Sustainable Haringey and Tree Trust for Haringey<br /><br /> Campaign around proposed use of Hornsey Town Hall - led to greater liaison with Council representatives, local residents and press<br /><br /> CSA with a farm in Hertfordshire - attracting interest through local press and people not normally interested in transition</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition&nbsp;Town Kingston</td><td>We run a lot of events in partnership with other groups, which has helped a lot.  Our Unleashing attracted lots of groups as exhibitors too.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Bloomsbury</td><td>No, but just having a presence in the area has been a wonderful networking tool</td></tr>
<tr><td>Greenacre Project - Transition Finchley</td><td>Greenacre bicycle rally - connects with other cycling organisations<br /><br /> Greenacre short story comp - nationwide<br /><br /> </td></tr>
<tr><td>Sustainable Haringey</td><td>Not really, just networking</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Belsize</td><td>Camden Green Fair (but we didn't run it - we just had a stall there for all Camden's Transition groups)<br /><br /> London Permaculture Festival - again, we had a Camden Transition stall</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ham United Group (HUG)</td><td>Ham Library bird & butterfly garden</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>As a group what do you think your strengths are?</h3>
<table>
<tr><td>Finsbury Park</td><td>Mothers in group with links to local schools, clear focus, reasonably diverse by age and gender </td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Westcombe</td><td>Networking</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Crouch End</td><td>Interesting mix of people and skills - horticulture/ community gardening, psychotherapy, teaching and training, youth work, business, LETS, facilitating Heart and Soul events, arts and crafts <br /><br /> Very good networking with other environmental initiatives, e.g Green on the Screen (a montly film club), the Meadow Orchard Project, (a community garden) and Hornsey Vale Community Centre</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition&nbsp;Town Kingston</td><td>Committed core, good understanding of climate change/peak oil/renewables, experienced group of local organisers with long experience of running Kingston Green Fair, age/gender diversity, strong links with local government/MPs and press</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Bloomsbury</td><td>We take a somewhat different approach to the traditional TT model. For us, we have chosen to be an information provider by having a well-sourced online site and to focus on our own home and those immediately around us. This has been wonderfully transformative for both us and our neighbours and we recently celebrated our success by holding an Edible Fire Escape Party. Compared to 18 months ago, the back of the apartments where we live has entirely changed. No longer are we strangers to our neighbours nor they to us. Instead we chat regularly on the landings, swap spare seeds and produce, and celebrate the greenery that is growing on all levels. The apartment blocks next door are looking over the fence and commenting on the change they're seeing. With time, the idea to do something similar in their backyard will self-seed itself. For the most part the people around us have undertaken this change themselves out of their own realisations, understanding of the world and their place within it. Perhaps this approach is our strength.    </td></tr>
<tr><td>Greenacre Project - Transition Finchley</td><td>Passion and dedication </td></tr>
<tr><td>Sustainable Haringey</td><td>Good active core group, relentless networking, good liaison with Haringey council </td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition&nbsp;Town Stoke Newington</td><td>Very approachable and welcoming</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition&nbsp;Kensington &amp;&nbsp;Chelsea&nbsp;initiative</td><td>Perseverance!</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Belsize</td><td>Coordinators who put a lot of time in, lots of ideas, strong interest in core sub-groups like foraging, speed of progress, having the previous ward councillor in the steering group, having a friendly local supermarket owner, having a friendly local pub with an upstairs space we can use for free</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ham United Group (HUG)</td><td>Project are inclusive and cross all barriers </td></tr>
</table>
<h3>What do you think your weaknesses are?</h3>
<table>
<tr><td>Finsbury Park</td><td>Weaknesses - lack of time isn't a weakness, but it's our biggest constraint. I'd like to paid to do it because it's practically a full time job! Um weaknesses, probably the same as what people said before: trouble getting and keeping volunteers, trouble getting people who accurately reflect our diverse area. We are also a bit patchy. There's some areas we're great at, but it's hard to maintain consistent attention on projects over time when it's volunteer led. So when someone drops the ball it can take a while for someone else to realise something needs to be done / have time to pick it up. We could have better links with the local governments rather than being so project focussed - the big picture stuff. But if we had more people I think all of this would be easier. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Westcombe</td><td>Few active members or volunteers</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Crouch End</td><td>Different backgrounds and experiences mean sometimes we have different aims and aspirations which are hard to mesh.<br /><br /> Tendency to attract the same groups of people to events - we are however making greater use social media (Facebook and Twitter) to reach wider audience</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition&nbsp;Town Kingston</td><td>Limited success so far in reaching some important local groups (Korean/Muslim communities in particular), difficulty coming up with local demonstration projects</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Bloomsbury</td><td>We can be somewhat time-poor due to full-time work commitments. Having said that, we are doing the best we can given our current situation and we don't berate ourselves for not being able to push things along faster than they can possibly go. An extra few core members would be good but that will come when the time is right.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Greenacre Project - Transition Finchley</td><td>Lack of volunteers</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sustainable Haringey</td><td>Not reaching large groups in the Borough - youngsters, ethnic groups</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition&nbsp;Town Stoke Newington</td><td>Lack of time avaialble from people to commit to group</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition&nbsp;Kensington &amp;&nbsp;Chelsea&nbsp;initiative</td><td>We've been slow to learn the pertinent characteristics of the multi-cultural communities that predominate in our part of the borough (north Kensington), the ways in, what resonates. Result is we have probably appeared as stereotypical of types that these locals have learned offer little of interest to them. So after two years, we've been on a sort of crash course in changing cultural perspective and how we offer what we have. We shd know soon if our reappraisal results in greater uptake..</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Belsize</td><td>Avoiding burnout by the coordinators, not doing enough visioning, differentiating between doing and getting somewhere, sometimes a bit too much doing vs being</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ham United Group (HUG)</td><td>Not getting our message out - not singing our praises and shouting about what we do.  Still being over cautious</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>What additional skills or experience do you think your group would benefit from?</h3>
<table>
<tr><td>Finsbury Park</td><td>project management</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Westcombe</td><td>Fundraising</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Crouch End</td><td>Input from bodies like NEF to raise awareness of local economy would be very helpful in a place like Crouch End, whose ethos is that of a little village<br /><br /> It would also help us initiate schemes like markets (farmers'/community)and raise our profile in the business community - we already have links with the Crouch End Project.<br /><br /> A further outcome would be the seeding of small social enterprises within Crouch End (around growing food and craft.<br /><br /> Following on from that, web design skills to create a dynamic website which would act as an information hub and resource bank for the community.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Bloomsbury</td><td>Not so much skills or experience per se, but we wish we had a projector as we love showing films. It's such a wonderful medium that so powerfully captures a lot that we cannot adequately convey by just talking to people about the bigger picture of what is going on.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Greenacre Project - Transition Finchley</td><td>More volunteers</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sustainable Haringey</td><td>Running interactive events</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition&nbsp;Town Stoke Newington</td><td>More project management experience, knowledge of other more experienced TT groups.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition&nbsp;Kensington &amp;&nbsp;Chelsea&nbsp;initiative</td><td>1. Becoming familiar with what a multi-culturalist approach offers that has appeal across a broad spectrum of ethnicities.<br /><br /> 2. How to make engaging presentations<br /><br /> 3. How to design events to include a culturally appropriate mix of fun, socialising and learning</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Belsize</td><td>More basic manual skills like woodworking and more emotional/psychological workshops.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ham United Group (HUG)</td><td>Media - composing literature</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>What support have you received from your local government?</h3>
<table>
<tr><td>Finsbury Park</td><td>Haringey - money, volunteer org support, project support, offered us stall space at their compost give away event. Islington - money, project support (building and growing projects). Hackney - contacts at council have provided info but as yet, no money. Haven't hindered growing projects. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Westcombe</td><td>Information</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Crouch End</td><td>Making the Difference Bid above led to greater links with council officers from the Crouch End Neighbourhood Office.<br /><br /> The group was invited to give a presentation at a Local Area Assembly on transition and how people can become involved.<br /><br /> We are also part of Sustainable Haringey Network who liaise closely with Haringey Counil on policy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition&nbsp;Town Kingston</td><td>They are generally supportive, and acted on our campaign for local implementation of the Sustainable Communities Act.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Bloomsbury</td><td>Lots of positive verbal support when chatting to councillors at local fairs etc.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Greenacre Project - Transition Finchley</td><td>see above</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sustainable Haringey</td><td>Some grants for particular projects.  Often consulted and have the chance to talk issues over with Council officers</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition&nbsp;Town Stoke Newington</td><td>Some non-financial support from Hackney council for community garden project</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition&nbsp;Kensington &amp;&nbsp;Chelsea&nbsp;initiative</td><td>Our borough is the source of the funding for the film and the six-month programme. They are more clued up on climate (and its challenges) than we realised.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Belsize</td><td>I'm the ex-ward councillor which means: a) I knew where to go for anything local government might be able to help with and b) we didn't go to Camden Council with our Transition Belsize hat on until we had been through our birthing pains and had a physical manifestation of the project to show off. The council now has a regular stall at the Belsize Green Fair, pays us to do Draught-Busting Workshops, has a liaison officer for Transition groups and includes us in consultations.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ham United Group (HUG)</td><td>Great response from the Parks and Library Depts</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>In what ways have you been able to influence your local government?</h3>
<table>
<tr><td>Finsbury Park</td><td>Haven't tried yet. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Westcombe</td><td>Meeting on traffic</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Crouch End</td><td>Greater awareness of transition aims from Local Area Assembly<br /><br /> Contributed to policy on food<br /><br /> Raised objection to use of remodelling of green space outside Hornsey Town Hall at Planning and Development Meeting which was taken on board</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition&nbsp;Town Kingston</td><td>See above.  We also have a number of members on the Council's Sustainability group and had good input into their Core Strategy document, which included a Transition type vision of Kingston in 2030!  Our Council Group could give a much better answer to this question though!</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Bloomsbury</td><td>Asked some tough questions from time to time. </td></tr>
<tr><td>Greenacre Project - Transition Finchley</td><td>We have a very good relationship with the Sustainability & Waste team - Mike Gee the chairman is also Secretary of the Finchley Society Environmental & Transport Committee and is slowly building some very good relationships which will in turn influence the community - unfortunately London Borough of Barnet is pro-car and intent on selling green space.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sustainable Haringey</td><td>Input to consultation documents.  Ideas for Green Fair and other green events that are Council run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition&nbsp;Town Stoke Newington</td><td>Not tried</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition&nbsp;Kensington &amp;&nbsp;Chelsea&nbsp;initiative</td><td>That'll come in due course.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Belsize</td><td>By having a member of the steering group as a local councillor and Camden Eco Champion! It's hard to say exactly how Transition Belsize has influenced the council. I think it's fair to say that we're now firmly on their radar as a legitimate and important community group, and that they come to us when they need help with stuff eg Draught-Busting/behaviour change, or they listen to us when we go to them with advice or questions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ham United Group (HUG)</td><td>By being committed to community involvement and becoming sustainable</td></tr>
</table>
<h3>Have you had an unleashing? If so, if you did it again what would have have done differently and what worked best?</h3>
<table>
<tr><td>Transition Westcombe</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Crouch End</td><td>Not yet</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition&nbsp;Town Kingston</td><td>Yes, it was brilliant!  Full write-up here:<br /><br /> <a href="http://www.darkoptimism.org/2010/04/20/ttks-great-unleashing-big-launch-party/">http://www.darkoptimism.org/2010/04/20/ttks-great-unleashing-big-launch-party/</a><br /><br /> Wouldn't really have changed anything, which is quite something now that I think of it!<br /><br /> </td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Bloomsbury</td><td>No, just our Edible Fire Escape Party :-)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Greenacre Project - Transition Finchley</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sustainable Haringey</td><td>No as we are not a Transition group.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition&nbsp;Town Stoke Newington</td><td>No yet</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition&nbsp;Kensington &amp;&nbsp;Chelsea&nbsp;initiative</td><td>No</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Belsize</td><td>Nope. We're not sure how it would advance things for us. Haven't ruled it out though.</td></tr>

<h3>Comments</h3>
<table>
<tr><td>Finsbury Park</td><td>Business: tried to do a shop local project whereby local bag would advertise shop local message as well as giving users a discount in participating shops, but didn't have anyone to take project forward.  Would like to do 9carrots project in area.<br /><br />  Heart and Soul: meditation group has been a good way of linking local groups. Truth mandala session has linked up transition leaders in north london. Plans to do more peer support work<br /><br />  Schools: good connection with Parkwood primary, growing connection with Stroud Green Primary and Ambler</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Crouch End</td><td>Have a look at a writeup of Transition Crouch End on our Transition Network page.<br /><br /> <a href="http://www.transitionnetwork.org/initiatives/crouch-end">http://www.transitionnetwork.org/initiatives/crouch-end</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition&nbsp;Town Kingston</td><td>The key thing for us has been understanding that our first job is to build community, and our second job to discuss CC/PO/economics.  Without the first, the second is largely redundant.<br /><br />  The project we are perhaps most proud of is our organic box scheme, which is Soil Association certified and sourced from local farmers, but still manages to be cheaper than the supermarkets!  <br /><br />  Also the Unleashing, as discussed above.  <br /><br />  Our new website (<a href="http://www.ttkingston.org/">http://www.ttkingston.org/</a>) and our fantastic 10 minute TTK movie (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3gFd6iiYJw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3gFd6iiYJw</a>) are also highlights to date</td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition Bloomsbury</td><td>Transforming the rear of the apartments where we live has been a major achievement. It inspires us and those around us. <br /><br />  Also, Todd is now one of the managers of The People's Supermarket, which is at the end of the street where we live. The store is very supportive of the TT model and his day-to-day involvement has an influence on the way the store is run. This, in turn, is noted by the customers who take various stories away with them - hopefully to facilitate change in their own lives.<br /><br />  All the best,<br /><br /> Todd & Marietta </td></tr>
<tr><td>Greenacre Project - Transition Finchley</td><td>GBR - mass bike rally - 3rd year<br /><br /> Greenacre Writers - we believe creativity is integral to self-sufficiency<br /><br /> Eco Film club - approx every 2 months</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sustainable Haringey</td><td>Our food group has set up a community supported agriculture link with a farm in Stevenage.  They now deliver food boxes to us every week and we send volunteers for work days. <br /><br /> Our Friends of the Earth groups got the council to sign up to 10:10 and commit to further emissions cuts.<br /><br /> </td></tr>
<tr><td>Transition&nbsp;Kensington &amp;&nbsp;Chelsea&nbsp;initiative</td><td>What's most amazing is that we still have any group at all, after two years, around 30 Film Nights, three (or was it four?) name changes, changes of venue, digging deep in pockets to cover room rental, all the technical blips and hitches you can imagine, unwieldy borrowed projectors on bicycles - and just four members to show for it! Then we were recognised by the local social council as a valuable resource for bringing climate awareness to the local public. They became our 'banker' and got the film makers and the council environment dept execs into negotiating a deal out of which we get this film which will be shown in all cinemas, pubs, gymns, Post Offices, schools, colleges in the borough and as a warm-up for our own, yet-to-be devised evening events to run October - March 2011.  It may not have been the fun we were expecting, but it has been fun!</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ham United Group (HUG)</td><td>Our community allotment at Ham House - the National Trust have now rolled out a nationwide programme of food growing on unused plots of their land.</td></tr>
