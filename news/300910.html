<h2><a name="NEWS">NEWS</a></h2>

<p>At the moment it's looking like I will stop publishing this newsletter
later this year.</p>

<p>After running the this mailing list for almost a year there are now just
over 130 people subscribed, with a around 5-6 new people joining every
month. The online newsletter pages are generally getting around 60 visits,
although some of these will be people already be on the mailing list.</p>

<p>Even with a fair degree of automation the production of each newsletter
still takes almost a full day, so with this current level of readership
and growth it's difficult to for me justify the time commitment versus
other projects.  In this time Project Dirt has matured greatly and now
offers a similar newsletter, although with a slightly different focus.</p>

<p>I have no data on how useful the newsletter is at publicising events to
the public, but I imagine it is useful as a way of keeping different
Transition-related groups up-to-date with what else is going on London and
serves as a source of inspiration about events that could be replicated
locally, such as the spread draught busting workshops last winter. If
nothing else I've certainly learnt a lot putting it together.</p>

<p>The London Trandition web site on the other hand gets around 20-30
visits a day and some of the other material I've published is still popular,
so I think my time would be better spent developing the information on
the site and working on more original content.</p>

<p>So, this is my thinking at the moment. If you have any ideas, suggestions,
feedback or offers of help about the newsletter or the London Transition please
get in touch.</p>
